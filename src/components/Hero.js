                <h1>Its all about good food & taste</h1>
                <p>The flavor of your food is what most customers focus on when they are deciding what to eat. How you present the dishes on your menu can help build anticipation, and a good menu description could even convince a hesitant customer to try something new. With this in mind, it's important to be precise and thorough when choosing words to describe your food's flavor.
